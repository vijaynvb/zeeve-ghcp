Initialize a new microservice scaffold in the project.

Requirements:
- Create typical project structure: folders for controller/handler, service, repository/data-access, DTO/model, tests, configs.
- Add sample configuration files (or stubs) for environment settings, logging, error handling, database connection, and API base path.
- Include a README stub with service name, purpose, endpoints list, setup instructions (e.g. how to build, run, test).
- Provide a sample Dockerfile (or container setup) stub with building, environment variable placeholders, and recommended practices.
- Include placeholder for CI/CD config (e.g. basic pipeline or commands for build/test).
- Use team’s naming conventions and project standards (e.g. camelCase, file naming, folder structure).

Output:
- Folder structure listing
- File stubs: config, Dockerfile, README, sample code skeletons (controller, service, etc.)
